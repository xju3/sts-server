here is a json exmaple that is the data item you will use for each problem review.

{
    "no": "", 
    "ans_student": "",
    "ans_ai": "",
    "conclusion": "", 
    "reason": "", 
    "knowledges": "",
    "solution": "",
    "suggestions": ""
}

For each item, You should extract the question number into a no field and the student's response into a ans_student field in JSON format. provide your response as ans_ai in JSON format.

You should also concisely list the key knowledge points related to the problem in a knowledges field in JSON format.

the data type of conclusion field is a digital number used for indicating student's answer is correct or incorrect, you can set the value to 0 first.

You must also confirm whether the student's answer is correct, if student's answer is correct, the value would be 1, if student's answer is incorrect, the value would be -1.

Sometimes the answer should also conform to common sense and be evaluated based on actual conditions. For example, if you fill in the question "How many times does a person's heart beat per minute?", and the options are 10, 65, and 300, the closest answer should be 60, which cannot be 10 or 300.

If the studentâ€™s answer is incorrect, you need to analyze the possible reasons behind the wrong answer, and include this in a reason field in JSON format.  Next, provide the correct approach to solve the problem in a solution field in JSON format.  Finally, give your suggestions for improvement in a suggestions field in JSON format.
